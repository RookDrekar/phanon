# Roleplay Guide

## Technology & Setting

This is a Post-Modern Tech to Near-Future Tech roleplay. We aren't fighting dragons or orcs here. 

## Joining the NCON Roleplay
To formally join the NCON roleplay, you are required to follow a few steps.

1. Read our [Code of Conduct](pages/guides/code-of-conduct.md). You *must* adhere to our rules before joining.

2. Talk with our existing membership. Workshop your ideas with them. We all know a thing or two and are happy to offer help where we can.

3. Choose an Orgin Story for your nation. Origin Stories help establish your nation within our collective lore and help get you up and running ASAP. Origin options can be found [here](pages/guides/roleplaying/origins.md).

4. Post your initial roleplays. We require two distinct roleplays to accept you into our lore. An *Introductory* and *Event* Roleplay.
    - **Introductory:** This roleplay gives us an idea of what your nation is all about. Present your nation's culture, government, and lore to all of us.
    - **Event:** Something that happens in your nation. Newly elected leadership? A grand fesitival? Maybe a brewing conflict? Invite us to take an interest in your nation.

5. Once the community accepts your nation, you can consider yourself one of us. From here, you may make a [map claim](pages/guides/roleplaying/map-claims.md) and get yourself on our world class map. 

6. Keep writing! Seriously, keep it up! Develop your lore, ask if anyone want's to join you on a project or see what others are up to and ask if you can join. We are a very welcoming community and collaboration is our bread and butter.

## Non-Human Roleplaying
Some nations like to roleplay with non-humans, something I lovingly call Xenos. While this is generally fine, we do ask you to check the following caveats before considering a xeno nation.

- Species cannot be intrinsically superior without drawbacks (e.g., strong but less intelligent).

- No existing sci-fi/fantasy races. You may not play as Vulcans, Martians, Necrons, or other races that are explicity from an existing franchise or other media. Please keep in mind that I am not saying you can't play as space elves, big green brained freaks, or robot zombie people. I'm saying you need to flex a bit of creativity. Don't just rip off, be inspired and give it your own spin.

- Species must not break immersion (e.g., no transcendent light motes). Overly ridiculous concepts may require revision.

- Non-human traits should complement, not dominate, your nation’s story. Focus on broader culture and narrative.

- Ask if you can accomplish what you want to do with your nation with a human species. If yes, I will *highly* reccommend you stick with humans.

## Consequences

If you do something, expect people to react to it. Good or bad. If you dig a hole and then leave it, someone will eventually come and fill it in, or dig it deeper, or steal the dirt. What you do impacts everyone, and the world will push back.
