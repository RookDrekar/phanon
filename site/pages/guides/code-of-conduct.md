# NCON Code of Conduct

To live in harmony with all of us here, we have set forth a fair few expectations. Our code of conduct is divided into sections: Role-Playing and Out-Of-Character.

## Role-Playing Code of Conduct

### 1. Ask Permission
> What you do with your nation is your choice, but if what you will do will impact another nation, you *must* get clear, informed, and public consent from that nation. This is non-negotiable. To clarify what is okay, I have provided what I call the Circles of Control.

>**Your Sovereignty:** Your leadership, important characters, national infrastructure, population, and other essential personnel are yours alone to control. 

>**Your Independents:** From time to time, a nation might like to use a non-essential member of your nation for a roleplay. This could be a news correspondent, a diplomat, a breadmaker, or asylum seeker. These are generally used as one-off characters. It's still important to ask, but the stakes are lower.

### 2. No Godmodding
> Probably the most common rule you will find no matter where you roleplay. You may not have access to technology or other forces that pose an existential risk to our worlds. You may not act so unilaterally with such astounding might that you can't be opposed. This means no death stars, no harvesting the molten core of our world, and no super plagues.

### 3. Don't Steal
> Just don't outright steal another player's ideas, projects, content, characters, etc. If someone created a roleplay that inspires you, ask them to join in that roleplay. You can cooperate, even competitively!

### 4. Collaborate
> NCON is first and foremost a collaborative storytelling region. We aren't here to paint the map with your nation's color. We aren't here to wage endless and senseless wars on each other. We are here to tell an awesome story and build a rich, vibrant lore.

### 5. Listen to Consensus
> If you act in a way that violates our community standards or is considered aberrant to our general norms/culture, the community may ask that you amend your roleplay. We cannot cover every single eventuality in this Code of Conduct, so our community will rule on faults they find.

### 6. Gamemaster Has Final Say
> Ultimately, the Gamemaster has final say. The Gamemaster's mission is to provide the best possible space for roleplays to thrive. If they ask you to change, amend, or delete something, it is probably for good reason.

## Out-of-Character Code of Conduct

### 1. Respect One Another
> This is not optional. You will respect your friends, peers, and fellow players while staying with us in NCON. You know exactly what respect is. Don't pretend you don't.

### 2. Act With Nobility
*Nobility can be broken down into 5 critical components:*

> **Integrity:** Be true to yourself and others. Tell the truth. Align your words with your actions. Do what's right. Honor your commitments.

> **Compassion:** Support your peers. Offer genuine kindness to one another. Foster a friendly and welcoming environment.

> **Humility:** Recognize your faults, limitations, and weaknesses. None of us are perfect. Accept criticism as an opportunity to improve.

> **Responsibility:** Own what you do. Know that everything you do has an impact on others.

> **Generosity:** Help others. Don't let someone go unheard. If you have talent and time, offer it to someone who would benefit. 

### 3. No Harassment or Discrimination
> Harassment, bullying, or discrimination based on race, gender, sexuality, religion, or any other personal characteristic will not be tolerated. This includes derogatory language, threats, or any behavior that makes others feel unsafe or unwelcome.

### 4. Report Issues Promptly
> If you witness or experience any violations of this Code of Conduct, report them to the Gamemaster or a designated moderator immediately. We rely on our community to help maintain a positive environment for everyone.
